# NYC-Taxi-Data
This data set contains New York City taxi data, which is analyzed for functions like average commissions and common locations during the evening. I loaded the parquet file and selected the relevant columns involving locations, tolls, and commissions. After selecting the desired columns, I saved it as a new file.
