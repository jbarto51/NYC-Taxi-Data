# NYC-Taxi-Data
This data set contains New York City taxi data, which is analyzed for functions like average fares, congestion surcharges, and common locations during the evening. For the ETL process, I loaded the parquet file and selected the relevant columns involving locations, tolls, and commissions. After selecting the desired columns and dropping the null values, I saved it as a new file.
